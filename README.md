# three.js test
Made this interactive sphere thanks to [this Gary Simon's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUgWfqWZWmM&t=379s&ab_channel=DesignCourse "Gary Simon's tutorial") (used other blend mode because the one he used had a problem with the lightning interfering in the h1).
Looking forward to experiment and add my own Blender models in next projects üßê.
